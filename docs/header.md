======================

Monitoring for Microsoft Windows Devices.

Background
----------

This ZenPack provides support for monitoring Microsoft Windows.
Monitoring is performed using the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) and
Windows Remote Shell (WinRS) to collect Windows Management
Instrumentation (WMI) and Perfmon data.

This ZenPack supersedes the earlier ZenPack named
`ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor`. If you have `ZenPacks.zenoss.WindowsMonitor`
installed on your system, please read the [Transitioning from
WindowsMonitor](#transitioning-from-windowsmonitor) section below.
